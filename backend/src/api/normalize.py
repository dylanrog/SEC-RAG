    """Normalize for citation matching, returning a normalized->original offset map.

    `offset_map[i]` is the index in `text` of the character that produced
    `normalized[i]`. A character may produce zero characters (a whitespace
    run after the first) or several (NFKC expands ligatures, casefold expands
    the eszett), so the map is built per source character rather than derived
    from lengths.

    NFKC is applied per character, not to the whole string. That loses
    composition across character boundaries (an "e" followed by a combining
    acute stays two characters instead of becoming a single "e-acute"), which
    is the price of an exact offset map. It is safe here because both the
    quote and the chunk text pass through this same function: a sequence that
    fails to compose fails to compose identically on both sides, so the match
    still succeeds.
